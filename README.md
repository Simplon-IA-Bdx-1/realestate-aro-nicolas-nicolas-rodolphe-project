# CUSTOM REAL ESTATE PREDICTION

For now, we only focused the Gironde area.

## Steps to make it work

You need to have at leat [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environments manager installed on your machine.

### Building a local server

- Clone this repo and from the command line acces it.
- Create the conda env with this command: `conda create -f environment.yml` at the root of the repo.
- You need to launch the `python flask-app?server.py` command to initialize the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) server. 
- You're now ready to launch the `python app.py` command to launch the command line interface and fire yout first prediction.
